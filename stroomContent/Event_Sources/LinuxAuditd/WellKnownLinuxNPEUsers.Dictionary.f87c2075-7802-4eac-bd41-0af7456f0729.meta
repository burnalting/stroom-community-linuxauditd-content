  "description" : "This is a list of well known Linux Non Person Entity (system) users. This list is used to label a User/Type as 'NPE' so that different actions can be taken.\nFor example, the processed event can be stored in a  different Feed to that of the inbound raw Feed. This way, events which only have 'system' users involved\ncan have a smaller retention period."
